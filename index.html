<p> We are a group of academic researchers at Canadian universities working on web3, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrencies. <span style="font-family:monospace">a/w/c</span> is split into three groups: devotees, aficionados, and enthusiasts. 

<ul>
<li> <strong>Devotees</strong> primarily work on projects related to web3. We are highly dedicated, often leading initiatives and pushing the boundaries of the field.</li>
<li> <strong>Aficionados</strong> primarily work on different topics but have made meaningful contributions to web3. We are passionate and knowledgeable, contributing valuable insights and expertise from our primary fields.</li>
<li> <strong>Enthusiasts</strong> have minimal experience with web3 but are interested in exploring it. We are curious and eager to learn, bringing fresh perspectives and energy to the field.</li>
</ul>
